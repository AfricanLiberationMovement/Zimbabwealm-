<p><strong>AFRICAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT STRUCTURE 
  </H2>
    
    
</strong></p>
<p>The African Liberation Movement is a powerful force for change, with a clear roadmap defined by our 7 pillars. These pillars are the foundation of our movement, guiding us towards our ultimate goal of liberation for all Africans.
    
</p>
<h3>Woman Wing</h3>
<p>
  </p>
  The first pillar is the Women Wing, which is made up of three levels: Local Board, National Board, and International Board. Each state has its own Local Board, with representatives from all regions. These representatives also participate in the Liberty House, a space for women to come together and discuss important issues. Additionally, there are 10 women representatives from 10 states who make up the National Board. The International Board is chaired by 3 women who represent the entire women's pillar on an international level.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h3> Men Wing </h3>
<p>The Men Wing operates in the same way as the Women Wing, with Local, National, and International Boards. This wing is responsible for addressing the specific challenges faced by men in our society and working towards their empowerment.</p>
<h3> Youth Wing </h3>
<p>The Youth Wing is a crucial pillar, as the youth are the future of our movement. This wing is made up of young leaders who are passionate about creating a better future for Africa. They are responsible for organizing events, workshops, and campaigns to engage and educate young people on the issues facing our continent.</p>
<h3>Traditional Wing</h3>
<p>The Traditional Wing is made up of traditional doctors, fortune tellers, sharmans, singers, performers, and writers of African descent. This wing is essential in preserving our cultural heritage and traditions, which are often under threat from Western influences. They also play a vital role in healing and spiritual guidance for our people.</p>
<h3> AI/Technology </h3>
<p>The AI/Technology Wing is responsible for the development of AI, technologies, sciences, spying, research, information control, and media. This wing recognizes the importance of staying ahead in the technological world and using it to our advantage in the fight for liberation.</p>
<h3> Head Honchos</h3>
<p>The Head Honchos are representatives of civil workers, government operations, and adherence to procedures. They are responsible for monitoring the conditions of our people, addressing shortages and outbreaks, and ensuring that human rights and laws are upheld. They also serve as a policing force for the movement and the general public.
</p>
<h3>Elder Wing</h3>
<p>Elderly Wing, which is made up of chiefs and an advisory committee of retired members, army, police, teachers, and so on. This wing provides valuable knowledge and guidance to the movement, drawing on their years of experience and understanding.</p>
<h2>LIBERTY HOUSE</h2>
<p>Welcome to our Liberty House, where our democracy thrives and our voices are heard. Our house is divided into three chambers, each with its own purpose and representatives.</p>
<h3>FIRST CHAMBER</h3>
<p>In the first chamber, where the seven pillars of our society are represented. These pillars include the Women Wing, Men Wing, Youth Wing, Elderly Wing, AI/Technology Wing, Head Honchos Wing, and Traditional Wing. </p>
<p>Each of the 10 states in our country sends one delegate to represent their respective pillar, making a total of 70 representatives in this chamber.</p>
<p>The first chamber is chaired by 10 National Organisers, who ensure that the voices of all pillars are heard and represented.</p>
<h3>SECOND CHAMBER</h3>
<p>
  Moving on to the second chamber, we have the National Directors, who are responsible for overseeing the work of the first chamber. This chamber consists of 10 National Organisers, who bring the collected information from the first chamber, and 3 National Directors and their vices. Here, the National Directors work closely with the National Organisers to ensure that the message is shared with leaders and decisions are made accordingly.</p>
<h3>LIBERTY CHAMBER</h3>
<p>
  Finally, we have the Liberty Chamber, which is the highest authority in our house. This chamber is chaired by the Leader and his two vices, one man and one woman. In this chamber, all important matters are addressed and decisions are made. The leaders are expected to give clear direction and make decisions that will benefit the general public using directly information from the lower chambers. Every decision made in this chamber is signed and recorded, ensuring that it is put into action.
  </p>
    
</p>
<p>Our Liberty House is a symbol of unity and democracy, where every voice is valued and every decision is made with the best interest of our society in mind. We are proud to have a system that allows for the representation of all pillars of our society and ensures that our leaders are held accountable for their actions. Together, we will continue to build a better future for our country.</p>
<h2> African Liberation Movement </h2>
<h4>A movement is not a political party; it operates outside of political guidelines. Its purpose is to dismantle existing systems and create new ones that are tailored to the needs of its environment and society. A movement is driven by individuals who are passionate and selfless, with a deep concern for the well-being of the people.</h4>
